<a href="#about-classes-inheritance-and-rs-object-oriented-systems" class="anchor"></a>About Classes, Inheritance, and R’s Object-Oriented Systems</h3>
<p>In object-oriented programming, code is oriented around “objects”. “Classes” are definitions of types of objects that share the same attributes and functionality. For more information, see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">Wikipedia article</a>.</p>
<p>In the concept of inheritance, children classes are extensions of their parent class in that they—generally speaking—are a superset of their parent class. Children classes “inherit” attributes and functionality from their parent classes. This reporter graphs the inheritance between the classes of a package, with inheritance as a directed edge from a child class to its parent class.</p>
<p>R has four main object-oriented systems: S3, S4, and Reference Classes are part of base R; the R6 package provides another commonly used system.</p>
<p>This reporter supports the S4, Reference Class, and R6 systems. S3 classes are not supported because their inheritance is defined on an ad hoc per-object basis, rather than formally by class definitions.</p>
<p>For more info about R’s built-in object-oriented systems, check out the relevant chapter in <a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/OO-essentials.html">Hadley Wickham’s <em>Advanced R</em></a>. For more info about R6, check out their <a href="https://r6.r-lib.org/index.html">documentation website</a> or the chapter in <a href="https://adv-r.hadley.nz/r6.html"><em>Advanced R</em>’s second edition</a>.</p>
